Hive is a powerful and popular package for Flutter apps that acts as a lightweight and fast NoSQL database for local data storage. It allows you to easily store and retrieve data on the device itself, even when offline.

Freezed is a Flutter package that helps developers write clean, maintainable code by generating boilerplate code for immutable classes: 
 -Reduces boilerplate code: Freezed automatically generates repetitive parts, which can save developers time and effort. 
 - Improves code quality: Freezed supports features like null safety and union types, which can help reduce bugs and improve code maintainability. 
 -Simplifies state management: Freezed can assist with state management using the Freezed BLoC pattern. 
 -Supports JSON serialization: Freezed allows for the serialization and deserialization of JSON data

BLoC stands for Business Logic Components. It aims to separate the application's business logic from the User Interface, making the application code more unambiguous, scalable, and testable
